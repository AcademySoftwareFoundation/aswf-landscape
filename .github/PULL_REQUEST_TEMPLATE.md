### Pre-submission checklist:

*Please check each of these after submitting your pull request:*

* [ ] Are you including a `repo_url`? You need to pick the single best GitHub repository for your project, not a GitHub organization.
* [ ] Is your project open source?
* [ ] Has this project been used successfully in the production of a film, television program, animated content or other projects within the scope of the ASWF. Was it designed specifically for the entertainment industry?
* [ ] Is the project currently and actively maintained (e.g., accepts pull requests, replies to issues, has been tested against / builds properly with the compilers for this year's VFX platform)?
* [ ] Have you picked the single best (existing) category for your project?
* [ ] Does it follow the other guidelines from the [new entries](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/aswf-landscape#new-entries) section?
* [ ] Have you added the SVG for your logo to `hosted_logos` and referenced it in the entry in `landscape.yml`?
* [ ] Does your logo clearly state the name of the project/product and follow the other logo [guidelines](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/aswf-landscape#new-entries)?
* [ ] Does your project name match the text on the logo?
* [ ] Have you verified that the Crunchbase data for your organization (including headquarters and LinkedIn) is correct?
* [ ] ~5 minutes after opening the pull request, there will be a link to preview the entry on the staging server. Have you confirmed that it looks good?
