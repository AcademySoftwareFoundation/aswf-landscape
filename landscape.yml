              It was formed on November 1, 2015, renamed from the personal computer and printer divisions of the original Hewlett-Packard Company, with its enterprise products and services businesses becoming Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The split was structured so that Hewlett-Packard changed its name to HP Inc. and spun off Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a new publicly traded company. HP Inc. retains Hewlett-Packard's pre-2015 stock price history and its former stock ticker symbol, HPQ, while Hewlett Packard Enterprise trades under its own symbol, HPE.[2][3]

              HP is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the S&P 500 Index.

              input datasets with full film complexity, and that are licensed to allow publishing research results and software demonstrations. Disney‚Äôs Moana Island is a prime example
              of what we want to encourage, but in addition to 3D scene data, assets could also be images, image sequences, volumetric data, animation rigs, edit decision lists, etc.
