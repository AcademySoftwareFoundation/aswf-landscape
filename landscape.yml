              enterprise products and services businesses becoming Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The split was structured so that Hewlett-Packard changed its name
              to HP Inc. and spun off Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a new publicly traded company. HP Inc. retains Hewlett-Packard's pre-2015 stock price
              history and its former stock ticker symbol, HPQ, while Hewlett Packard Enterprise trades under its own symbol, HPE.[2][3]

              In order to encourage development and research that addresses the true scale, scope and requirements of computer graphics film production, the
              Asset Repository seeks to publish and maintain curated exemplars of the data sets used in our industry. Research projects and commercial
              development projects often have trouble obtaining input datasets with full film complexity, and that are licensed to allow publishing research
              results and software demonstrations. Disney‚Äôs Moana Island is a prime example of what we want to encourage, but in addition to 3D scene data,
              assets could also be images, image sequences, volumetric data, animation rigs, edit decision lists, etc.
